# Vulnerable Forum

This is a vulnerable web forum to act as dummy application to be the punching bag for whilst doing my ethical hacking lab for class.

SQL Inject the login form however you'd like, even at the command-line!:

#### Stored Cross-Site Scripting
Stored XXS attacks are fun, huh?:

```shell

  -d "title=Hacked&content=<script>alert("Hacked!")</script>' 
  --cookie "cookies.txt" \
  --cookie-jar "cookies.txt"
```
